# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub Issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
- Go to this repository on GitHub
- Click **Security**
- Click **Report a vulnerability**
- Fill out the form with steps to reproduce, impact, affected versions/commits, and any proof-of-concept details

If you don’t see the **Report a vulnerability** button, private reporting may not be enabled for this repository.

## What to expect

- Reports are reviewed and triaged as quickly as possible.
- You may be asked for additional details to reproduce or assess impact.
- If accepted, remediation will be coordinated via GitHub Security Advisories.
